	Team squirrelsACD shall be creating a game inspired by Galaga. In this game, there will be two “Shooters” each controlled by one player. These “Shooters” will remain locked in the same, but opposite, ‘y’ positions and only be able to navigate the ‘x’ plane. Each “Shooter” will be able to fire projectiles at targets that will be flying horizontally through the screen.
	The players will be competing against each other in order to determine who is able to shoot the most targets within a determined time limit. Each time a fired projectile hits one of the targets, the “Shooter” responsible will get a point. At random and/or predetermined intervals, “Power Ups” will fly through the screen. These power ups will vary in effect with a myriad of positive abilities/qualities given to the player responsible for shooting them. A player, when shooting a power up, may be granted more projectiles, larger projectiles, or more points per target hit. There will also be “Power Downs” with negative effects reaped on the player. They may lose points, lose ammo, or lose the round.
	We will also ensure the game has basic functions for an easy to use interface such as a pause button, restart button, or an option to return to the main screen. Changes will be made to the project as needed.
